title: "Commands"

Commands are defined actions your mini app can perform in World App. Every command is available as either:

-   a synchronous function that dispatches an event, the result of which has to be listened for,
-   an async function, that can be awaited, resolves with the result.

To quickly get a sense of how commands work, you can scan the QR code below with your phone (you must have World App installed).

Or, open this link with your phone: https://world.org/mini-app?app_id=app_dfbe55706a640c82dce839bb0ecae74d
