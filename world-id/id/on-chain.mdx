title: "On-Chain Verification"
---

World ID proofs can be fully verified on-chain. After all, the source of truth for the decentralized protocol is on-chain. To verify a World ID proof, your smart contract will embed a call to the `verifyProof` method of the World ID contract, and then execute the rest of its logic as usual.

The [smart contract starter kit](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) and the [frontend & on-chain monorepo template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) are great resources to help you get started with World ID.
Using one of these repositories is strongly recommended to get started with World ID on-chain.

The following examples demonstrate the most common use case: verifying proofs from only Orb-verified users, for a single action, with a user's wallet address as the signal, while also enabling sybil-resistance.

This setup is recommended for most users, as it is the most gas-efficient. For more information on use cases that require more complex setups (such as multiple actions or other types of signals), see the [Advanced On-Chain Verification](/world-id/id/on-chain) page.

<Note>
At the core of the World ID Protocol is the use of [Semaphore](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/). Semaphore is a zk-SNARK based privacy protocol that allows for the creation of anonymous credential systems developed by the Ethereum Foundation. Read more about [The Protocol](https://whitepaper.world.org/#world-network-protocol) and [Semaphore](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/).

## IDKit Configuration

When verifying proofs on-chain, there are a few changes you have to make to your IDKit configuration. You must ensure that the app created in the Developer Portal is configured as an on-chain app, and you should only accept Orb credentials in IDKit, as World ID Device is not currently supported on-chain.

```tsx
import { IDKitWidget } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

const { address } = useAddress() // get the user's wallet address

<IDKitWidget
    app_id="app_GBkZ1KlVUdFTjeMXKlVUdFT" // must be an app set to on-chain in Developer Portal
    action="claim_nft"
    signal={address} // proof will only verify if the signal is unchanged, this prevents tampering
    onSuccess={onSuccess} // use onSuccess to call your smart contract
    // no use for handleVerify, so it is removed
    // use default verification_level (orb-only), as device credentials are not supported on-chain
>
    {({ open }) => <button onClick={open}>Verify with World ID</button>}
</IDKitWidget>
```

## Contract Addresses

The World ID Router contract is what you should use to verify proofs. It is deployed on multiple chains, and you can find the addresses for each chain in our contracts [Address Book](/world-id/reference/address-book).

## `hashToField` Helper Function

Our contracts use a custom hash function that returns a `uint256` that is guaranteed to be in the field of the elliptic curve we use. This is necessary to ensure that the `uint256` returned by the hash function can be used in our zero-knowledge proofs.

```solidity
library ByteHasher {
	/// @dev Creates a keccak256 hash of a bytestring.
	/// @param value The bytestring to hash
	/// @return The hash of the specified value
	/// @dev `>> 8` makes sure that the result is included in our field
	function hashToField(bytes memory value) internal pure returns (uint256) {
		return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(value))) >> 8;
	}
}
```

To use this function, simply import the `ByteHasher` library and call `hashToField` on your bytestring.

```solidity
import { ByteHasher } from './helpers/ByteHasher.sol';

contract HelloWorld {
	using ByteHasher for bytes;
	// {...}
	abi.encodePacked('hello world').hashToField(); // returns the keccak256 hash of 'hello world' as a uint256
	// {...}
```

## Constructor

The `externalNullifier` is the unique identifier of the action performed in Semaphore, and its keccak256 hash (named `externalNullifierHash`) is what is passed to the World ID Router contract. It is a combination of the app ID and the action.
You should typically set it in the constructor to save gas (as is done in this example), as it will not change if all users are performing the same action.

We additionally set the `groupId` to `1`, which limits this example to Orb-verified users only. World ID Device is currently not supported on-chain.

```solidity
/// @dev This allows us to use our hashToField function on bytes
using ByteHasher for bytes;

/// @notice Thrown when attempting to reuse a nullifier
error InvalidNullifier();

/// @dev The address of the World ID Router contract that will be used for verifying proofs
IWorldID internal immutable worldId;

/// @dev The keccak256 hash of the externalNullifier (unique identifier of the action performed), combination of appId and action
uint256 internal immutable externalNullifierHash;

/// @dev The World ID group ID (1 for Orb-verified)
uint256 internal immutable groupId = 1;

/// @dev Whether a nullifier hash has been used already. Used to guarantee an action is only performed once by a single person
mapping(uint256 => bool) internal nullifierHashes;

/// @param _worldId The address of the WorldIDRouter that will verify the proofs
/// @param _appId The World ID App ID (from Developer Portal)
